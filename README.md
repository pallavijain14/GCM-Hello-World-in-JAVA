# GCM-Hello-World-in-JAVA

Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) is a block cipher mode of operation that uses universal hashing over a binary Galois field to provide authenticated encryption/decryption.

#AES Encryption/Decryption

The AES uses symmetric encryption, meaning that the secret key used for encryption is the same one used for decryption.
